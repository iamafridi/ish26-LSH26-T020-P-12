/**
 * Insights — required item 3's "at least three insights that name specific
 * categories and amounts rather than giving general advice".
 *
 * OWNER: Architect.
 *
 * DESIGN NOTE — why these are rules, not an LLM call.
 * The brief demands insights derived "from the actual numbers". A language model
 * asked to comment on a table will occasionally round, drop a digit, or invent a
 * category, and there is no way to grade that. So every sentence below is
 * generated from the computed figures, and each insight carries an `evidence`
 * object holding the exact values it quotes — the UI highlights from it and the
 * tests assert on it. The LLM is used where it genuinely helps (reading a
 * receipt photo, see lib/ocr) and kept away from arithmetic.
 *
 * Generators are pure and independently testable. Each returns null when it has
 * nothing worth saying, so an empty or single-category month degrades cleanly
 * instead of emitting "Your top category is undefined (NaN%)".
