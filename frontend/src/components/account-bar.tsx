/**
 * Who you are signed in as, and how to become someone else.
 *
 * Not decoration. Every figure in this application is scoped to one account, and
 * a ledger showing someone else's salary looks exactly like a ledger showing
 * your own — there is no visual difference between "your April" and a
 * colleague's except the identity printed here. On a shared laptop, or during a
 * demo where several accounts get used in a row, that is the difference between
 * reading your own numbers and quietly reading someone else's.
 *
 * The shared demo account is called out explicitly, because anything typed into
 * it is visible to everyone else using it and that is worth knowing before you
 * enter a real salary.
 *
 * "Switch account" is a sign-out followed by the sign-in screen rather than an
 * in-place picker: Firebase holds one session at a time, so a list of accounts
 * would be a promise the auth model cannot keep.
