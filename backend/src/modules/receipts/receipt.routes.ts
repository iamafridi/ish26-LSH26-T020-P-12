/**
 * Receipt scanning — required item 1's "upload a photo of a bill or receipt,
 * read the amount, date and shop name".
 *
 * THE REVIEW GATE IS ARCHITECTURAL, NOT A UI CHOICE.
 * This endpoint reads an image and returns a DRAFT. It has no access to the
 * expense collection and cannot write a row. The only way a scanned receipt
 * becomes an expense is a subsequent POST /expenses carrying values the user
 * submitted from the review form.
 *
 * That is deliberate. The brief requires the user to be able to "correct any
 * field before saving", and a gate enforced only by the frontend is one refactor
 * away from being bypassed. Enforced by the shape of the API, it cannot be.
