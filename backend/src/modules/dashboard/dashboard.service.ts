/**
 * The keystone. Assembles the signed-in user's stored records into the exact
 * `LedgerCase` shape the P12 dataset uses, then runs the one engine entry point
 * over it.
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE MATTERS
 * `buildReport` is also what the verification harness runs against all 25 public
 * cases, and against an independent Python implementation of the same spec. By
 * making the live application feed that identical function, the figures a user
 * sees on the dashboard are produced by code that is proven correct against the
 * published dataset — not by a second, unverified implementation that happens to
 * live in the API layer. There is exactly one place in this system where money
 * is computed.
 *
 * Required items 2, 3 and 4 are all served from this one call.
